# MissObs

Note: This package is prepared for practice only.

The goal of this R package `MissObs` is to count missing values for all
columns by group. The function `abcd` in this package takes the
dataframe and returns a data frame or tibble with the levels of `group`,
and the number of NAs within each level of `group` for all columns
in`data` except `group`.

# Installation

You can install the development version of MissObs from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2023/MissObs")
```

# Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# Load the package
library(MissObs)

## Load sample data

library(datateachr)

## load sample data with some NAs

missing_NAs<-count_all_missing_by_group(flow_sample, extreme_type, .groups = "drop")
missing_NAs
#> # A tibble: 2 Ã— 7
#>   extreme_type station_id  year month   day  flow   sym
#>   <chr>             <int> <int> <int> <int> <int> <int>
#> 1 maximum               0     0     0     0     0   106
#> 2 minimum               0     0     2     2     2    13
```

In the tibbles you can see the function returned the total number or
counts if missing values for each groups. For exmaple, the value of the
variable **flow** is missing 2 times from the minimum category for value
is not missing from the maximum category of the group variable
**extreme_type**
